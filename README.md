## Optimizations

There is definetly much more to optimize for better user experience. 
Among these optimizations are:
- A sign out button
- Profile dashboard
- Animation
- Propery booking block after someone books one
- Responsive Layout for Mobile and tablet devices
- And many more! Will add a changelog once I get time to do some of these feautures
